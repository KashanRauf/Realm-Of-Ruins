## Instructions for repository
Before pulling the repository:
* Install the Unity Editor (Version 2021.3.34) from here: https://unity.com/releases/editor/archive
* Create a project using the 2D core template (not 2D URP)
* After that you can pull the repository to the project folder
* Send a screenshot in the GC of what the project looks like in the editor so I can confirm it works

When pushing to the repository
* Do not push to the main branch, the team will review, test, and then approve (or change) any additions before that

I recommend using GitKraken for version control, makes it easy to manage commits and branches, you can get premium for free as a student (just ask me if you don't know how to get it).

IF SOME THINGS DON'T WORK PROPERLY JUST MESSAGE ME AND I'LL SEE WHAT'S WRONG AND FIX IT
