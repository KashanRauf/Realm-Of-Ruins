# CISC 226 Project- Group 47
Realm of Ruins

## Instructions for repository
Before pulling the repository:
* Install the Unity Editor (Version 2021.3.34) from here: https://unity.com/releases/editor/archive
* Create a project using the 2D core template (not 2D URP)
* After that you can pull the repository to the project folder
* Send a screenshot in the GC of what the project looks like in the editor so I can confirm it works

When pushing to the repository
* Do not push to the main branch, the team will review, test, and then approve (or change) any additions before that

I recommend using GitKraken for version control, makes it easy to manage commits and branches, you can get premium for free as a student.

## Additional resources
Stuff that may be useful, include a link/name and a short description
* [Brackeys](https://www.youtube.com/@Brackeys) on Youtube, tons of great tutorials on game design
* [Visual Studio 2022](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/), as opposed to VSCode (what I assume most people use), this version of visual studio has way better Unity integration and intellisense
* [Numberphile's Golden Ratio video]() can give you some interesting ideas for the generating bullet patterns, our entire mechanic is built on top of this
